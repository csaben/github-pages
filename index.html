    <h1>Upwards w/ Arelius</h1>
    <p>The goal of this will be to now go ahead and setup a functional, somewhat acceptably styled website in which to document my machine learning escapades</p>

    <h1>Temporary Blog Set-up</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to day two of my 30 self imposed Kaggle progression!</h2><br>
    <p>A valid question to start with is: <div style = color:DarkSlateBlue> why I am 
    making a github.io page while I should be diving head first into the plethora of 
    Kaggle content that there is to consume?</div><br> Well, I think it would be awesome if by
    the end of the 30 days I haven't just gotten through a lot of material, projects, and hopefully
    a competition or two but also developed a way to really bring everything together, as such
    this long winded introduction was born. </p>
