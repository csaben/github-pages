    <h1>Upwards w/ Arelius</h1>
    <p>The goal of this will be to now go ahead and setup a functional, somewhat acceptably styled website in which to document my machine learning escapades</p>

    <h2>Temporary Blog Set-up</h2>
    <h3>Welcome to day two of my 30 self imposed Kaggle progression!</h3><br>
    <p>A valid question to start with is: <div style = color:DarkSlateBlue> why I am 
    making a github.io page while I should be diving head first into the plethora of 
    Kaggle content that there is to consume?</div><br> Well, I think it would be awesome if by
    the end of the 30 days I haven't just gotten through a lot of material, projects, and hopefully
    a competition or two but also developed a way to really bring everything together, as such
    this long winded introduction was born. </p>

    <h2>Takeaways from Day 2 of the Kaggle progression so far</h2><br>
    <p>First of all, I am quite behind my peers. I don't say this to merely be self deprecating, but rather
        to act as a reference point as to what I was when I look back after the end of these 30 days and later on
        in my development. Just for posterity here is my current proficiency to look back on later:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Python: Intermediate</li>
            <li>HTML: functional (lol)</li>
            <li>Machine Learning: Novice(+)</li>
        </ul>
